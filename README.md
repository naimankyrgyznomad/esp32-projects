# esp32-projects
I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering student building a embedded portfolio using EPS32 platform.
## Goals (Winter break)
- Build sensor-based systems and document them clearly
- Practice embedded programming in C++ for Arduino framework
- Implement finite state machines
- Create a standalone data logger (OLED + SD card)
- Add WIFI monitoring

## Tools
- ESP32-32S
- C++
- Sensors: DHT11, HC-SR04, PIR
- OLED display (SSD1306)
- MicroSD logging (SPI)

## Projects (haven't decided yet)
- 00 Toolchain Test
- 01 Data Logger
- 02 State Machine
- 03 IoT Dashboard

## Status
Toolchain installed and compilin; waiting for hardware shipping.
